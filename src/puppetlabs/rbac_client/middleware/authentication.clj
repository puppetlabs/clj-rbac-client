  If no token is found, no :subject is set and the handler is called (presumably
  to be blocked by the block-anonymous-access middleware later). If a token is
  found and is invalid or a valid token represents a revoked user, a 401 is
  returned with a relevant error map.

  When the token is provided as a request parameter, this middleware has some notable
  interactions with several ring middlewares. The token parameter is fetched from
  the :params map inside the request, which relies on the ring.middleware.params
  middleware, and checks for the string \"token\", which middlewares like
  ring.middleware.keywords-param middleware may break if run before this middleware.
  So in short, this middleware should be used after the 'wrap-params' middleware but
  before any middleware that might alter the structure of the :params map."
